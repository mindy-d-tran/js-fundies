## About
This code returns an `array` that contains `objects`. Each object shows each **student's id**, **class avg** for all assignments due, and **individual scores for each assignment** with it's `key` as the assignment id.

## Errors it catches
- checks if due_at and submitted_at are of type `string`.
- checks if all IDs are of type `number`.

## Acknowledgments
I would like to thank my friend, Roshan, for helping me make the code more readable.
